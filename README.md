<h1 align="center" id="title">PHBG (Procedural Hip-hop Beat Generator)</h1>

<p id="description">PHBG is a program designed to generate hip-hop infused beats using procedural generation. As a music producer myself the original goal of this project was to automate tasks that were repetitive in my creative process. As time went on the project's scope expanded and the current version is now able to generate entire instrumental tracks with variations and multiple instruments. It was designed with Trap music in mind (for artists like Future, Migos or Travis Scott) but can technically be used in other creative contexts.</p>
